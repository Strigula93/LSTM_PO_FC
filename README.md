# LSTM_PO_FC
This Streamlit app accepts an Excel file, builds per-item weekly and monthly time series from the Item column, and trains TensorFlow/Keras LSTM models to produce forecasts. It shows training curves, error heatmaps, data and forecast plots, summary metrics (MSE, R²), and lets users download the results as a CSV.
